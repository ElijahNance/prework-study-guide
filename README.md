# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I created this project to have an easier/more efficient way to study. It keeps all my notes in one central location. I learned the basic fundamentals of building a webpage.

## Usage

The webpage can be used to study topics such as HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. If you open the DevTools console, you can see the JavaScript running. It lists the topics I learned from the prework and picks a random topic to study.
