          <li>CSS is a programming language used to define how webpage content is presented to users</li>
          <li>Inline CSS is used to style an element directly into the file</li>
          <li>Internal style sheets are used to embed an entire stylesheet directly into the HTML file</li>
          <li>External CSS style sheets allow developers to keep all their CSS rules in a seperate file</li>
          <li>Seperation of code refers to seperating code into different files based on use</li>
          <li>A selector defines the element or atrtributes to which the rules, or declarations will apply</li>
          <li>Declaration contain two components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property</li>
          <li>Margin properties indicate how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>  
          <li>Padding adds space around the content inside an element</li>
          <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself(DRY) is a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the nummber of lines of code written</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow you to share a CSS rule to any element you choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector</li>
